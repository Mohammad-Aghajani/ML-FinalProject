# Deep Learning on mnist Dataset Using MLP Neural Network
In this project, we are going to see the effect of cost on prediction accuracy due to changing loss function.  
Loss functions which they used in this project are as following:  
* [Softmax](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits)
* [Sigmoid](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits)
