## About
In this project, we are going to see the effect of cost on accuracy of prediction, due to the changing loss function.  
The Loss functions which are used in this project are as following:  
* [Softmax](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits)
* [Sigmoid](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits)
